# Intro to Dictionaries

**Dictionaries** are one of the most important data types available in Python. They are used to store key-value pairs. The simplest way of thinking about them is as a table with two columns. The first column is the **key**, and the second column is the **value**.

key
value

"Alice"
25

"Bob"
30

"Charlie"
35

Above we have a dictionary with three key-value pairs. The keys are `"Alice"`, `"Bob"`, and `"Charlie"`, representing names, and the values are `25`, `30`, and `35`, representing the age of each person. In this case, the pair `"Alice" -> 25` means that `"Alice"` is `25` years old.

Another way of phrasing it is we are *mapping* a key to the value. This is why dictionaries are sometimes called **maps** or **hashmaps** in other programming languages.

```python
my_dict = {"Alice": 25, "Bob": 30, "Charlie": 35}

my_dict = {
    "Alice": 25,
    "Bob": 30,
    "Charlie": 35
}
```

The above two dictionaries are equivalent, the second is just formatted differently. A dictionary is created using curly braces `{}` similar to a set. But dictionaries don't just store values, they store key-value pairs separated by commas. The key and value are separated by a colon `:`, with the key on the left and the value on the right.

```python
my_dict = {}

my_dict["Alice"] = 25
my_dict["Bob"] = 30
my_dict["Charlie"] = 35
```

As shown above, to declare an empty dictionary we can use empty curly braces `{}`. We can then add key-value pairs to the dictionary using square brackets `[]` and the assignment operator `=`. This is similar to lists, but keys don't have to be integers.

#### Challenge

You are given two functions to implement:

1. `create_dict(name: str, age: int) -> Dict[str, int]` should create a dict, mapping the `name` to the `age` and then return the dict.

2. `list_to_dict(words: List[str]) -> Dict[str, int]` should take a list of strings `words` and map each string to its index in the list, and return the resulting dict.
