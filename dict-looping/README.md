# Dict Looping

You can use `len()` to get the length of a dictionary. This will return the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.

```python
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

print(len(my_dict)) # Output: 3
```

But just like with sets, the length of a dict won't help us to loop over it. The good news is that looping over a dictionary is very similar to looping over a set.

```python
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

for key in my_dict:
    value = my_dict[key]
    print(key, value)
```

By using the `for` loop, we can iterate over the keys in the dictionary by using the `in` operator. We can then use the key to access the value associated with that key.

We can also use the `items()` method to loop over both the keys and values at the same time.

```python
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
```

This is a bit more concise, but it's up to you which method you prefer. While we named the variables `key` and `value`, you can name them whatever you like. Just know that with `items()` you need to have two variables to unpack the key-value pair. The first will be the key, and the second will be the value.

#### Challenge

Implement the following two functions:

1. `get_dict_keys(age_dict: Dict[str, int]) -> List[str]` should take a dictionary of names and ages and return a list of the names.

2. `get_dict_values(age_dict: Dict[str, int]) -> List[int]` should take a dictionary of names and ages and return a list of the ages.
