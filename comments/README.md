## 📋 Problem Description

In programming we can annotate our code without affecting the output. This is done using comments. Comments are ignored by the interpreter. They are used to explain what the code is doing or add any sort of message, usually for humans. They are useful for other programmers who may read your code, or for yourself in the future if you forget what a certain piece of code does.

In Python, comments are created using the # character. Any text after the # character on a line is considered a comment.

If we want to ignore a piece of code, we can also comment it out temporarily. This is useful for debugging or testing.

The above code will not print anything to the console because the line is commented out.

ChallengeYour task is to fix the code on the right without deleting any of the lines. It should print the following text to the console:

A short cut to comment out lines of code in most code editors is to select the lines you want to comment out and press Ctrl + / (Windows / Linux) or Cmd + / (Mac). This will automatically add the # character to the beginning of each line.
