# Dict Operations

Dictionaries can't contain duplicate keys, just like sets.

```python
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

print(my_dict["a"]) # Output: 1

my_dict["a"] = 4

print(my_dict["a"]) # Output: 4
```

As shown above, if we assign the same key a new value, the old value is overwritten.

The values within a dictionary can be of any type, including lists, sets, and even other dictionaries.

```python
my_dict = {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": {4, 5, 6}, "c": {"x": 7, "y": 8, "z": 9}}

print(my_dict["a"]) # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(my_dict["b"]) # Output: {4, 5, 6}
print(my_dict["c"]) # Output: {"x": 7, "y": 8, "z": 9}
```

The keys within a dictionary must be unique, but the values can be duplicated.

```python
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 1, "c": 1} # this is valid
```

To check if a dictionary contains a key, you can use the `in` keyword.

```python
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

print("a" in my_dict) # Output: True
print("d" in my_dict) # Output: False
```

#### Challenge

In the code editor, there is a dictionary called `your_dict`. Perform the following operations in order:

1. Print the dictionary itself.

2. Print the value of the key `"a"`.

3. Print `True` or `False` depending on whether the key `"d"` is in the dictionary.

4. Reassign the value of the key `"a"` to 4.

5. Print the dictionary again.

  
    *Are key-value pairs in a dict ordered?*
    

In Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries are ordered by the order in which they were inserted. This means that the order of key-value pairs in a dictionary is preserved.
