## 📋 Problem Description

More than having good variable names, it's important to follow naming conventions. These are rules that help us write code that is easy to read and understand.

There are several different naming conventions such as: Camel Case: The first letter of each word is capitalized except for the first word. For example, myVariableName.

Snake Case: Words are separated by underscores. For example, my_variable_name.

Pascal Case: The first letter of each word is capitalized. For example, MyVariableName. In Python, we typically use snake case. This means we use underscores (_) to separate words in variable names.

ChallengeRename the variables in the code editor to follow the snake case naming convention.
