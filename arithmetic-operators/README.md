## 📋 Problem Description

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. Addition +: Adds two operands together.

Subtraction -: Subtracts the second operand from the first.

Multiplication *: Multiplies two operands.

Division /: Divides the first operand by the second. The result is always a float. If we divide y by x, the result will be 2.0 and not 2. This is because the result of division is always a float in Python.

For the other arithmetic operators, the result will be an integer if both operands are integers. If one of the operands is a float, the result will be a float. What about order of operations? I'm glad you asked! The order of operations in Python is the same as in mathematics. The acronym PEMDAS can help you remember the order: Parentheses Exponents Multiplication and Division (from left to right) Addition and Subtraction (from left to right) For example, in the expression 2 + 3 * 4, the multiplication is done first, then the addition. The result is 14. To specify the order of operations, you can use parentheses. For example, (2 + 3) * 4 will result in 20. ChallengeIn the code editor, there are some integers and floats declared. Print the following in order: The sum of the values (addition)

0 minus the sum of the values

The product of the values (multiplication)

The sum of the values divided by the product of the values Hint: You are free to declare additional variables if it's helpful.
