## 📋 Problem Description

So far we've only learned about strings. But variables in Python can hold different types of data, such as integers, decimal numbers (aka floating-point numbers), strings, booleans, lists, and more. You will learn more about these later.

To briefly explain the code above: A variable is an integer type when it holds a whole number value.

A variable is a floating-point number type when it holds a decimal number value.

A variable is a boolean type when it holds a True or False value.

A variable is a string type when it holds a sequence of characters, inside quotes.

A variable is a list type when it holds a collection of comma separated values, inside square brackets. We can print the type of a variable or value using the type() function in Python. For example:

This will output:

ChallengeUpdate the code on the right so that the output is:

Hint: The values themselves don't matter, only the types.
