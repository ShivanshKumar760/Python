## 📋 Problem Description

There are a few more operators in Python that are commonly used in arithmetic operations: Floor Division //: Divides the first operand by the second and rounds down the result to an integer.

Modulus %: Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.

Exponentiation **: Raises the first operand to the power of the second operand. Here is an example of each:

ChallengeYou are given three variables, a, b, and c. Print the following numbers in order: The product of a and b, floor divided by c

The remainder of the product of a and b divided by c

The result of raising a to the power of b.

The result of raising b to the power of c. What is the precedence of each of these? Good question! The order of operations for these operators is as follows: Exponentiation ** Floor Division // and Modulus % In summary, we can still follow PEMDAS, and assume that floor division and modulus have the same precedence as multiplication and division.
